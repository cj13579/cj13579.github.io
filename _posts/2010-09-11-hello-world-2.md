Welcome to the revamped <a title="the new look site" href="http://cj13579.homelinux.org" target="_self">cj13579.homelinux.org</a>! I think that you will agree with me that it is much better than the <a title="The old site" href="http://cj13579.dyndns-server.com/old" target="_self">old</a> one. I have decided that I will put some effort into this one and  (but don&#8217;t hold me to this) regularly update it.

I don&#8217;t know what I am going to be writing about yet. I am thinking that it is going to have a technological focus. I will probably use it to showcase some projects that I am either working on or have in the pipeline. Or just stuff that I discover and wish to share with anyone who will care to read it.

Anyway, that&#8217;s enough from me for now.

Enjoy the site please. That is after all, what it is there for.

Chris
