My dad is retiring tomorrow and to celebrate his retirement he has decided that he is going to go on one almighty bike ride! It&#8217;s taking him to all corners of the UK and is going to take several weeks. So that he can keep a diary of his ride, and so people can keep up with how he is getting on, he has set-up a blog: [www.anoldmanandhisbike.com](http://www.anoldmanandhisbike.com).

If you want to keep up with his ride then feel free to head over there and subscribe to his updates!
