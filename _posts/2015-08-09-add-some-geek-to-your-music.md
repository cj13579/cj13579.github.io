The music player cmusÂ is wonderfully geeky with its command line interface. It starts up in a flash and is my new favourite way to play music on my laptop. I use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi" target="_blank">vi</a> the text editor a significant amount at work so the controls for this came relatively easy. Their man pages are out of this world as well.
